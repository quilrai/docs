# UX Changelog

Recent interface improvements and quality-of-life changes.

## OpenAI Realtime API

Native websocket passthrough for OpenAI's Realtime API (voice and text).

- Point clients at `wss://guardrails.quilr.ai/openai_realtime/v1/realtime` (or the `/openai/v1/realtime` compat alias) with a QuilrAI API key
- OpenAI and Azure OpenAI variants supported via `openai_realtime` / `openai_realtime_azure` provider types
- API key can be passed via `Authorization` header, `api-key` header, query parameter, or `openai-insecure-api-key.*` subprotocol (browser-friendly)
- Live-event DLP coverage is not included yet - see [Security Guardrails](./features/security-guardrails#endpoint-coverage)

## OpenAI Responses API

Native support for OpenAI's Responses API format.

- Endpoint: `/openai_responses/v1/responses` with create / retrieve / cancel / delete / list-input-items
- Azure-deployment-style alias also registered
- Request-side DLP scans `input_text` parts plus top-level `instructions`; response-side DLP scans `output_text` on non-streaming responses
- Streaming (SSE) supported; streaming bypasses response-side DLP per the standard gateway rule

## Tags

Add custom tags to API keys to organize by team, environment, or use case.

- Add custom tags to API keys to organize by team, environment, or use case
